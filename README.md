Twitter automation using TTYtter


! WARNING !
===========
This project is new and very not production-ready yet (even under the very generous assumption that there is some kind of production that could possibly use it).


Preparation
-----------
1. Execute `install.py` and follow the instructions
2. Put some example posts into the text file `config/posts.txt` (each line is a post).


Usage
-----
Executing `script.sh` will tweet one of the candidate texts together with a random trending hashtag topic.
